## 2026-09-02 — Is a similarity gate a workable way to stop duplicated work?

- **Design.** Replay all 2,043 watched files as if newly created; sweep the
  block threshold; require the four real duplications of that day to keep firing.
  `.claude/hooks/calibrate-prior-art-guard.mjs`.
- **Result.** **No.** Four rounds of tuning could not get the firing rate below
  ~30% while keeping the true positives:

  | threshold | would block | true positives |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0.60 | 49.1% | 2/2 |
  | 0.70 | 33.2% | 1/2 |
  | 1.00 | 29.9% | 1/2 |

  In a repo organised into families (`ft-*`, `build-*`, `report-*`) the base rate
  of legitimate similarity is high, so a ranked filter's precision tracks it.
- **Consequence.** The gate was redesigned to be **unconditional** — declare
  prior art in any new file under watched roots — with the similarity list
  demoted to advisory. Nothing to tune, nothing to argue about.
- **Two ways the probe lied before it worked**, both worth remembering: it
  replayed existing paths that the guard skips and reported a reassuring **0%**;
  and it invoked a hook path that did not exist, where `else allowed++` counted
  every failed spawn as a pass. A probe needs a positive control, and absence of
  a signal is not evidence of a pass.
- **Artifact.** PR for `.claude/hooks/prior-art-guard.mjs`.
