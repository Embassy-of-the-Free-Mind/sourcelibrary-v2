# Job hosts: where a headless job runs, and how it reports

**Read this when** you are about to hand a brief to `claude-job.sh` (dispatching a fork to a box), writing a brief, or changing the wrapper. Background: #6358, #5709, #6076, #6181, #6223.

## The wrapper

`scripts/workers/claude-job.sh` is the one job wrapper for every box. `/root/bin/claude-job.sh` on a box is a **copy** of it, refreshed after each pull by `scripts/workers/install-claude-job.sh` (new file, then `mv`).

- **Never edit `/root/bin/claude-job.sh` on a box.** Change the repo file in a PR. Live jobs execute the installed file for hours, and bash reads a running script incrementally, so an in-place edit changes the script under them. The hand-copied twins also drifted twice (2026-10-04, 2026-10-09).
- Host differences live in the `HOST` block at the top of the script, nowhere else.
- To install by hand after a merge: `bash /root/sourcelibrary/scripts/workers/install-claude-job.sh`. It refuses a file that is not committed and keeps the previous wrapper as `claude-job.sh.prev`.

## The boxes

| Box | Address | What else runs there | Job limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| main (`hetzner`) | `root@46.224.122.120` | every pipeline worker and cron | no slice; root disk fills (#6223) |
| cloudlayer (`earthai-live`, ARM) | `root@46.224.208.175` | the live Cloud Layer globe | `sourcelibrary.slice`: 14 GB, CPUWeight 30 |
| l7a (`earthai-l7a`, ARM) | `root@167.233.32.250` | the 0.6 km archive tick, every ten minutes | `sourcelibrary.slice`: 14 GB, CPUWeight 30 |

The boxes cannot ssh to main. Only the laptop reaches all three, so placement is decided on the laptop. The ARM boxes have no Python ML tools (kraken, CLIP, onnx): a brief that needs them goes to main.

## The spare lane on every box (#6395)

Each box is logged into a different Claude account (main: team@sourcelibrary, cloudlayer: derek@playpowerlabs, l7a: derek@sourcelibrary). `scripts/workers/spare-lane.py` runs from cron on all three and spends that account's allowance on small issues when the account is under its fair share of the week. Only main polls usage. It publishes the poll to Mongo (`ops_reports` `claude-limits:latest`, `claude-limits-share.mjs`), and the guests read it there, because no box can ssh to another. Cron: main `*/30` (in `crontab.production`); guests `15,45 * * * *`, logging to `/data/scratch/sl/logs/spare-lane.log`, guarded on the script existing. Jobs are named `spare-<issue>`, at most 2 on main and 1 on a guest, and an issue the lane picks is labelled `spare-lane` so no other box takes it.

## Placing a job: ask before you start

```
scripts/workers/job-where.sh
```

It asks each box for `claude-job.sh where` (load, free memory, free job disk, live jobs, and whether the box is ready to run a job at all) and names the emptiest. Start the job there:

```
scp brief.txt root@<box>:/tmp/ && ssh root@<box> /root/bin/claude-job.sh start <name> /tmp/brief.txt
```

Do not default to main. On 2026-10-09 main sat at load 17 on 16 cores with its root disk 86% full while cloudlayer ran no jobs.

## The brief: two header lines

Every brief carries these in its first 15 lines:

```
Lands: #6358
PR: yes
```

- `Lands: #NNNN` is the issue the job reports on. `Lands: none` means no comment is expected.
- `PR: yes|no` says whether a pull request is expected.

`start` prints a note when they are missing. Without them the wrapper guesses: the issue is the number the job name ends in (`second-reader-6338`), else the first `#NNNN` in the brief; a PR is expected only if the worktree holds commits beyond main. The guess is what paged Derek "did NOT land" for 58 of 113 finished jobs: the first number in a brief is often a cross-reference.

## What the landing check says when a job finishes

| Verdict | Meaning | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | comment found; PR found if one was expected; nothing left on the box | ntfy low |
| `REPORT:` | the comment or the PR was not found | ntfy low, and `landings.txt` for the morning digest |
| `AT-RISK:` | uncommitted files in the worktree, or commits that are on no remote branch and are not a PR's head | ntfy **high** |

A high page means work exists only on that box. The job's HEADLESS RULES tell it to leave `git status --porcelain` empty before it writes its done file, so scratch left in a worktree pages too: move it to `$JOB_SCRATCH`.

- One job: `claude-job.sh _land <name>`.
- Every finished job on the box, logged verdict beside the check run again now: `claude-job.sh backtest`.
- Every verdict is appended to `landings.txt` in the box's job directory (`date | host | name | verdict`).

## When a job does not finish, and what it asks (#6360 fixes 1–3)

- **Checkpoint on every non-DONE exit.** GAVE UP, a weekly cap, `stop`, and the sweep's "died twice" all commit the worktree (gitignore applies; files over 5 MB, the shared `node_modules` link, the vendored bundle and `.vercel` are left out) and push it to the job's branch, or to `<branch>-checkpoint-<time>` if that push is refused. The page names the branch. A lost job costs time, not results.
- **A weekly cap stops the job instead of waiting.** The 6-hour wait is for the 5-hour session window only; a weekly cap resets in days. The page says to restart from the brief on a box with headroom (`job-where.sh` on the laptop); the checkpoint branch holds the work.
- **No placement on a spent account.** `start` refuses when this box's account is at or over `MAX_WEEKLY_PCT` (90) of its weekly limit, read from the climits meter (`/root/.claude-limits/latest.json`, main box only; absent or stale = no check). `where` prints `weekly_pct` and reports `ready=no:weekly-NNpct`, so `job-where.sh` skips the box. Override: `JOB_IGNORE_LIMIT=1`.
- **Jobs decide two-way doors.** The HEADLESS RULES let a job raise `DECISION:` only above the $10 spend floor or on the hold list; anything else it decides and logs as `TAKEN:` (collected into `taken.txt`). DECISION lines go to `decisions.txt` for the morning digest and no longer page one by one.
